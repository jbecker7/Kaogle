For our group's final project for Mathematics 60C (Linear Algebra with Computing), we implemented a simplified version of the PageRank algorithm. In specific, we built a simple search engine named after Professor Kao which can be used to view indexed pages related to commemorative Coca-Cola bottles. 

We first implemented our simplified version of PageRank in Python and from there we used the Flask framework to allow for our version of PageRank to power an HTML/CSS/JavaScript Front-End UI.
