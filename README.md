# Implementing PageRank: Math 60C Final Project

Jonathan Becker, Josefine Bystrom, Emily Fernandez, and Anne McDonald

For our group's final project for Mathematics 60C (Linear Algebra with Computing), we will be building a simple version of early Google from scratch. To achieve this, we will build PageRank in Python, using the Flask framework to allow for our version of PageRank to power an HTML/CSS/JavaScript Front-End UI.

Our report (still in progress) can be viewed [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/168w26zSdbw315mUQQL3IvprTDNY20_Jo_DBG9arYQ1M/edit?usp=sharing)

We can use the [Barb√°si-Albert Model](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/generated/networkx.generators.random_graphs.barabasi_albert_graph.html) to randomly generate the nodes and edges that we feed into PageRank.
